    odds are your shower spits out 1.5 gallons of water per minute. 
    A gallon, meanwhile, is 128 ounces, and so that shower spits out 1.5 ร 128 = 192 ounces of water per minute. 
    A typical bottle of water (that you might have for a drink, not a shower), meanwhile, might be 16 ounces. 
    So taking a 1-minute shower is akin to using 192 รท 16 = 12 bottles of water. */
