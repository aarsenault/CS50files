0.  How many different colors does each format support? 
    PNG: 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA colors, GIF: 256 (8-bit) different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space, JPEG: 24 Bit RGB
    BMP: 32-bit color
    

1.  Which of the formats supports animation?
    GIF


2.  Whatâ€™s the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
    Lossy compression alters the pixels in a way that is not reversable when compressing (as opposed to lossless). 
    This has the benefit of higher compression rates. 

3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
    JPEG, 
    
4. The clusters are "freed" and can be overwritten, but the data is not actually destroyed unless it is again used

5. You could destroy your HD or SSD, or you could overwrite the drive with 0s

6.  stdint.h is a header file that is pound included which defines standardized int types such as uint8_t etc. 

7.  Using these standardized typedefs allows for greater portability of code to different compilers/platforms because the int types
    have the same number of bits accross all platforms

8.  BYTE: 8, DWORD: 32, LONG: 32, WORD: 16

9.  BM

10. bfSize: The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    biSize: The size, in bytes, of the structure
    
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner

12. biBitCount 

13. If the pointer to the output file actually points to NULL (AKA there is no outputfile)

14. we are reading a chunk of data the size of the whole file, 1 time. 

15. 3

16. allows you to adjust the address of the pointer to skip over the padding

17. Means to change the pointer from it's current location (by the amount of padding)

18. TODO
